          <h2>Thanks for visiting.</h2>
          <p>I wanted to create this site to give people a better understanding of me and some of my accomplishments! I'm currently studying mechanical engineering
            with a concentration in mechatronics and am working on a minor in computer science. With M.E. being one of the most broad engineering studies, I believe
            it's important to have a strong understadning of all underlying studies, such as electrical or industrial engineering. This is also, why I am working towards a
            minor in computer science! Stay and check out some of my reports and projects that I've worked on! Now enough about my work here's a little about me.
          </p>

          <p>I was born and raised in Southern Califronia, before moving to the Central Valley around 10 years old. I have two dogs, Kingston, who
          is pictured above, and Harley my much bigger Mastiff. I love being outside, whether its at the beach, or hiking. There is so much out there
          in the world to explore and see. I truly believe nature is a spectacular thing, which is why I strongly beleive in working on clean renewable energy, and emission
          free vehicles.
